**Solidity Standard & ERC-165 Interface Calculator**

This repository contains the implementation of a custom Solidity standard and an ERC-165 interface calculator, developed as part of my master's thesis project. The standard describes an interface to restrict transferability for digital assets.

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured into two main directories:

- [`interface`](./interface/): ERC-165 interface calculator for the standard.
- [`standard`](./standard/): LSP22 Solidity Standardization

> The standardization file includes implementation snippets for granting signing permissions across abstracted accounts and features a range of functions, rules, and transaction flows.

## Development

- This standard continues to evolve as part of the [LUKSO LIPs](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/) standard library.
- Refer to the [LSP22 Transfer Restriction](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/pull/196) for discussions and enhancements.
